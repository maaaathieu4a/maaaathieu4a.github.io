Everything was closed back in march, I didn't want to invest too much money into that project either, so it's essentially built with what was laying around.
The build is basically a few thick OSB pannels (I know plywood is better, but these are 23mm; enough to be solid and it's inside) screwed directly to the roof frame for a wall that ended up approximately 62 degrees steep. There's a roof feature in the middle because of a beam crossing.

For holds I had access to a set of old entreprise holds from my dad. To be able to bolt them, I soldered a nut on a metal plate and screwed that on the backside in order to make some poor man's t-nut.
Most of the wooden holds are made with scrap wood, crimps are easy to do with plywood.
total budget is ridiculous since I had most of these things laying around and access to good tools already.

At the end some isolating pannels were added to the ceiling, which makes it a bit better but obviously was not helping much on the warmest sunniest days.

Special thanks to my dad for lending me that space and who helped me a lot to bring this wall to life.
