With the summer being over I wanted to move my hangboard indoors, it was simply not pleasant anymore to hang it in the garden.

[!jardin-poutre](/static/img/hangboard/TODO)

Since I have multiple spots where I like to hang my board, I thought I could try to implement a system allowing to easily hang it in different places and as a bonus swap multiple hangboards.

After looking a bit for some existing solutions, I went for something simple : 45degr√©s cuts that fit together.
I used scrap wood from TODOmm thick plywood planks.

The base board is sitting on a metal beam, with a few screws in to make it stable. (after tapping to allow M8 screws)
Not very aesthetic, gotta say, the wood was also attacked so I treated it, but it's sturdy and functionnal, pretty happy with it for a first try.

result with my hangboard :

Swapping it for a Simond board :

Just one more hangboard to adapt and I'll be set for the winter to come.

The next step will be to add a similar system in the garden for next summer and inside of my futur apartment.
