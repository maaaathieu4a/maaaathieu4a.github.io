# Context
Being lucky enough to have had the space to build some home climbing wall, the next step was to fill it with holds, since I have access to some basic woodworking tools I decided to make many of these myself. It saves some money, teaches me something, and ended up being quite fun.


# What kind of wood?
We'll want to use hardwood, something compact. For most of my holds I used scraps of plywood or pieces of old furniture that was trashed.

# What kind of tools?
I have a small band saw and a belt grinder. It's totally possible with just a handsaw (better if orientable), a wood file and sandpaper


# The side to hold
To make it easy I usually start from a rectangle or a triangle and pick one side where I'll want to shape an edge to hold on to.

There are two main factors about shaping the edge : the bezel and the edge's angle.

A very rounded bezel makes it more comfortable but reduces contact surface

Note that a flat or sloping hold forces you to stay "under the hold" to apply some force on it, on the other end an incut edge allows to pull "out of the wall" like on the following picture

# Attaches 
Most of those holds tend to be rather small and don't necessitate a bolt, I use screws for most of my holds. Besides, I seldom move them around.
Plan 2 or 3 screws per hold.

# Finishes

Not strictly necessary but it's more aesthetic to shape all sides, we also often want to render them unusable or really bad as potentiel footholds, sometimes add a thumb catch too.

Of course we can imagine all sorts of shapes and change a lot of parameters
