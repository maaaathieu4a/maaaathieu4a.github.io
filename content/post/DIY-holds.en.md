TODO Intro

# What kind of wood?
We'll want to use hardwood, something compact. For most of my holds I used scraps of plywood or pieces of old furniture that was trashed.
Using something too smooth could be damaged easily and screws might go too deep into it.

# hat kind of tools?

# Some simple base : a rectangle
To make it easy I cut my pieces into many rectangles.

# The side to hold
There are two main factors about shaping the edge : 
- the angle : incut or slopey ?
- the bezel : more rounding makes it more comfortable but reduces contact surface

Note that a flat or sloping hold forces you to stay "under the hold" to apply some force on it, on the other end an incut edge allows to pull "out of the wall"

# Attaches
most of those holds tend to be rather small and don't necessitate a bolt, I use screws for most of my holds. Besides, I seldom move them around.

Plan 2 or 3 screws per hold.

# bonus : the unused sides

Not strictly necessary but it's more aesthetic to shape all sides, we also often want to render them unusable or really bad as potentiel footholds.

Of course we can imagine all sorts of shapes and change a lot of parameters
