### WORK IN PROGRESS
I wanted to share a bit my little experience brewing beer with some other people, the idea to make a small workshop came last summer.
This is a free as in free beer workshop for members of the cultural and sportive association of my village. 

We planned a few brews all along the year, with a small group of people.

This article will cover the bases of the process we are using to brew approximatively 20L batches. It also aims at being a small guide for the participants.

## steps

#infusion
The water is heated separately up to about 73°C, then mixed to the mash in order to obtain a temperature between 67-69°C that will stay stable in our modified picnic cooler.

#Filtration
Our picnic cooler was modified to add a little tap at the bottom and I added a filter at the bottom (stainles steel braid), the biggest filter is actually our mash itself, I usually put the first few liters back in in an attempt to obtain a clearer result.

#Cooking
We want to get a guenine boil for 60-90minutes and we'll add in the hops to infuse

#Cooling
It's best to cooldown our resulting beer quicker to avoid oxydation and allow us to add the yeast sooner.

#Fermentation
once the soon-to-be-beer is at room temperature we can finally add the yeast and some water in the airlock.

#Bottling
Not my favourite part, it takes a huge amount of time to clean/disinfect all material including the bottles.
I chose to clean bottles by filling them first with a chemical product, then emptying and drying before filling them with beer.

A trick here is to use this long straw in order to bottom-fill the bottles, this avoids too much foam forming.
Finally, we printed some labels and stuck them with basic glue stick.
