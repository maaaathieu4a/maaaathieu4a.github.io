### WORK IN PROGRESS
I wanted to share a bit my little experience brewing beer with some other people, the idea to make a small workshop came last summer.
This is a free as in free beer workshop for members of the cultural and sportive association of my village. 

We planned a few brews all along the year, with a small group of people.
Unfortunately we only could do one before more covid-19-related restrictions.

This article will cover the bases of the process we are using to brew approximatively 20L batches. It also aims at being a small guide for the participants.

Another one will follow and add some informations about the amount of ingredients to use in order to create a recipe.
I also plan to publish these into a "zine" in pdf format soon.

Note : there are a few missing pictures

## The Steps

# Cleaning

It's very important to always use clean equipment, make sure to clean everything we'll use beforehand. We don't need yet to use desinfectant as we'll cook the whole batch anyways.

# Infusion
The water is heated separately up to about 73°C, then mixed to the mash in order to obtain a temperature between 67-69°C that will stay stable in our modified picnic cooler.

It's now time to have a well deserved break, I usually try to make this happen around lunchtime.

# Filtration
After 1h30-2h we can start pouring it.
Our picnic cooler was modified to add a little tap at the bottom as well as a filter inside (stainles steel braid), the biggest filter is actually our mash itself, I usually put the first few liters back in in an attempt to obtain a clearer result.

# Cooking
We want to get a guenine boil for 60-90minutes and we'll add in the hops to infuse at various times.

# Cooling
It's best to cooldown our resulting beer quicker to avoid oxydation and allow us to add the yeast sooner.
We use a copper tube with cool water to do that, it's best to move it a bit regularly to make it more effective.

We can now pour everything into a fermentation bucket that should be disinfected with chemo pro OXI.
It's possible to add a step in order to avoid hop deposits : into a first bucket with a filter, then in the final one.

# Fermentation
once the soon-to-be-beer is at room temperature we can finally add the yeast and some water in the airlock.

# Bottling
Not my favourite part, it takes a huge amount of time to clean/disinfect all material including the bottles.
I chose to clean bottles by filling them first with a chemical product, then emptying and drying before filling them with beer.
<!-- ![séchage](/img/brew/TODO) -->

A trick here is to use this long straw in order to bottom-fill the bottles, this avoids too much foam forming.
Finally, we printed some labels and stuck them with basic glue stick.
