(It will hopefully stop some day&mldr;</p><p>Multiple goals here : training-wise I want to get some variation from my 62 degrees wall, this one will be about 20 degrees steep.
It&rsquo;ll also allow me to use more holds, at this angle a much wider range should be usable.
As a nice bonus it will also be more accessible to some friends at a more modest climbing level.
But most of it was just to try and build a self-standing structure .
Space being a bit limited, the wall also has to be collapsable against the wall.</p><h1 id=a-lot-of-mistakes>A lot of mistakes</h1><p>The first one was to rush into a DIY store before the lockdown and buy whatever I could get without being certain of the dimensions because I didn&rsquo;t have any blueprints. I clearly don&rsquo;t have a good eye for this and no experience in carpentry. Add in some stress and I took sub-optimal building materials.
To add insult to injury all stores stayed open during this lockdown&mldr;</p><p>So I ended up with some planks being too thick and making the wall considerably heavier while some others were too thin and had to be doubled for the structure to be solid.</p><p>The second big one was to suppose that my pannels would make it stable by themselves with 4 vertical beams and only 1 horizontal one on top. Since I already had my hinges screwed I didn&rsquo;t want to take everything down to add another traverse.
So I ended adding a vertical pole on the left and the structure also stands against the opposite wall on the right. Not quite self-standing but thankfully the result is still satisfying : the wall is pretty stable.</p><p>It will also be possible to make it steeper by only changing one plank which is pretty nice.</p><p>Finally not having a kickboard is more impacting than I thought, even at such an angle. Sit-starts are often quite harsh. Next build will feature one, even if it&rsquo;s only 15cm.</p><h1 id=results>Results</h1><p>It&rsquo;s definitively satisfying, even if it&rsquo;s not perfect it does fulfill all goals.
The surface is small (240x200cm) so I added holds on the side and top to make them usable.
