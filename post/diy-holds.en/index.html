It saves some money, teaches me something, and ended up being quite fun.</p><h1 id=what-kind-of-wood>What kind of wood?</h1><p>We&rsquo;ll want to use hardwood, something compact. For most of my holds I used scraps of plywood or pieces of old furniture that was trashed.</p><h1 id=what-kind-of-tools>What kind of tools?</h1><p>I have a small band saw and a belt grinder. It&rsquo;s totally possible with just a handsaw (better if orientable), a wood file and sandpaper</p><h1 id=the-side-to-hold>The side to hold</h1><p>To make it easy I usually start from a rectangle or a triangle and pick one side where I&rsquo;ll want to shape an edge to hold on to.</p><p>There are two main factors about shaping the edge : the bezel and the edge&rsquo;s angle.</p><p>A very rounded bezel makes it more comfortable but reduces contact surface

Plan 2 or 3 screws per hold.</p><h1 id=finishes>Finishes</h1><p>Not strictly necessary but it&rsquo;s more aesthetic to shape all sides, we also often want to render them unusable or really bad as potentiel footholds, sometimes add a thumb catch too.
