This is a free as in free beer workshop for members of the cultural and sportive association of my village.</p><p>We planned a few brews all along the year, with a small group of people.
Unfortunately we only could do one before more covid-19-related restrictions.</p><p>This article will cover the bases of the process we are using to brew approximatively 20L batches. It also aims at being a small guide for the participants.</p><p>Another one will follow and add some informations about the amount of ingredients to use in order to create a recipe.
I also plan to publish these into a &ldquo;zine&rdquo; in pdf format soon.</p><p>Note : there are a few missing pictures</p><h2 id=the-steps>The Steps</h2><h1 id=cleaning>Cleaning</h1><p>It&rsquo;s very important to always use clean equipment, make sure to clean everything we&rsquo;ll use beforehand. We don&rsquo;t need yet to use desinfectant as we&rsquo;ll cook the whole batch anyways.</p><h1 id=crushing-malt>Crushing malt</h1><p><img src=/img/brew/concassage.jpg alt=concassage></p><h1 id=infusion>Infusion</h1><p>The water is heated separately up to about 73°C, then mixed to the mash in order to obtain a temperature between 67-69°C that will stay stable in our modified picnic cooler.</p><p><img src=/img/brew/infusion-temp.jpg alt=infusion-temp>
<img src=/img/brew/infusion.jpg alt=infusion></p><p>It&rsquo;s now time to have a well deserved break, I usually try to make this happen around lunchtime.</p><h1 id=filtration>Filtration</h1><p>After 1h30-2h we can start pouring it.
Our picnic cooler was modified to add a little tap at the bottom as well as a filter inside (stainles steel braid), the biggest filter is actually our mash itself, I usually put the first few liters back in in an attempt to obtain a clearer result.</p><h1 id=cooking>Cooking</h1><p>We want to get a guenine boil for 60-90minutes and we&rsquo;ll add in the hops to infuse at various times.</p><h1 id=cooling>Cooling</h1><p>It&rsquo;s best to cooldown our resulting beer quicker to avoid oxydation and allow us to add the yeast sooner.
We use a copper tube with cool water to do that, it&rsquo;s best to move it a bit regularly to make it more effective.</p><p>We can now pour everything into a fermentation bucket that should be disinfected with chemo pro OXI.
It&rsquo;s possible to add a step in order to avoid hop deposits : into a first bucket with a filter, then in the final one.</p><h1 id=fermentation>Fermentation</h1><p>once the soon-to-be-beer is at room temperature we can finally add the yeast and some water in the airlock.

I chose to clean bottles by filling them first with a chemical product, then emptying and drying before filling them with beer.</p><p>A trick here is to use this long straw in order to bottom-fill the bottles, this avoids too much foam forming.
Finally, we printed some labels and stuck them with basic glue stick.</p><p><img src=/img/brew/remplissage.jpg alt=remplissage>
