The build is basically a few thick OSB pannels (I know plywood is better, but these are 23mm; enough to be solid and it&rsquo;s inside) screwed directly to the roof frame for a wall that ended up approximately 62 degrees steep. There&rsquo;s a roof feature in the middle because of a beam crossing.</p><p>For holds I had access to a set of old entreprise holds from my dad. To be able to bolt them, I soldered a nut on a metal plate and screwed that on the backside in order to make some poor man&rsquo;s t-nut.
Most of the wooden holds are made with scrap wood, crimps are easy to do with plywood.
total budget is ridiculous since I had most of these things laying around and access to good tools already.</p><p>At the end some isolating pannels were added to the ceiling, which makes it a bit better but obviously was not helping much on the warmest sunniest days.</p><p><img src=/img/wall/wall-space.jpg alt=wall-space>
